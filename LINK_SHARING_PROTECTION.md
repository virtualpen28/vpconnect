# LINK SHARING UTILITY PROTECTION

## CRITICAL SYSTEM PROTECTION - DO NOT MODIFY

This document protects the Link Sharing utility from unauthorized changes.

### PROTECTED COMPONENTS

The following link sharing components are **CRITICAL SYSTEM FUNCTIONS** and must not be modified without explicit authorization:

1. **ShareLinkDialog Component** - `client/src/components/ShareLinkDialog.tsx`
   - Handles shareable link creation and management
   - Implements permission-based access controls (view, download, edit)
   - Manages public/private link settings
   - Password protection and expiration controls

2. **AWS Shareable Links Storage** - `server/awsStorage.ts`
   - createShareableLink() - Lines 2800-2900
   - getShareableLinksForResource() - Lines 2700-2800
   - updateShareableLink() - Lines 2900-3000
   - Caching mechanism for performance optimization

3. **Shareable Links API Routes** - `server/routes.ts`
   - GET /api/shareable-links/:resourceType/:resourceId
   - POST /api/shareable-links
   - PUT /api/shareable-links/:id
   - DELETE /api/shareable-links/:id

4. **Shared View Component** - `client/src/pages/SharedView.tsx`
   - Public link access validation
   - Password protection interface
   - Resource preview and download controls
   - Permission enforcement

### SYSTEM VERIFICATION STATUS

- **Last Verified Working**: 2025-06-19
- **Test Status**: All link types verified functional
- **Security Features**: Password protection and permission controls active
- **Performance**: Caching mechanism operational

### PROTECTION SCOPE

These utilities successfully implement:
- Secure shareable link generation with unique IDs
- Permission-based access control (view, download, edit)
- Public/private link settings
- Password protection for sensitive content
- Link expiration and usage limits
- Resource type validation (file/folder)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance caching for frequently accessed links

### LINK TYPES PROTECTED

1. **View Only**: 
   - Preview access without download capability
   - Content display with restricted controls
   - Right-click and keyboard shortcut blocking

2. **Download Access**:
   - View and download permissions
   - Controlled file access
   - Usage tracking

3. **Edit Access**:
   - Full permissions including modifications
   - Complete resource control
   - Administrative capabilities

### SECURITY FEATURES

- Unique link ID generation with collision prevention
- Password hashing and validation
- Expiration date enforcement
- Usage limit tracking
- Resource permission validation
- Input sanitization and validation
- DynamoDB serialization protection
- Cache invalidation for security updates

### DATA INTEGRITY PROTECTIONS

- STRING CONVERSION ERROR from AWS prevention
- SERIALIZATION ERROR 500 STORAGE prevention
- INCONSISTENT ARRAY IDs ERROR prevention
- DUPLICATE REQUIREAUTH MIDDLEWARE prevention
- API RETURNING EMPTY RESPONSES ERROR prevention

### EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

If modifications are required:
1. Document the specific need in this file
2. Create backup of current working version
3. Test all link types and permission levels after changes
4. Verify security features remain intact
5. Test caching and performance optimization
6. Update verification date upon successful testing

### MODIFICATION LOG

- 2025-06-19: Initial protection established
- 2025-06-19: Link sharing system components protected
- 2025-06-19: Security and performance features verified

**WARNING**: Changes to protected components may break the link sharing security system, permission controls, or performance optimizations.
